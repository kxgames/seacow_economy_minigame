    Calculate the price of an industry's goods.  The relationship between 
    supply and price is broadly inverse (i.e. 1/x).  This allows price to 
    decrease as supply increases, but in a way that increasing supply will 
    always increase the ultimate profit (i.e. price Ã— supply) by some amount.

    I wrote this function to overcome a shortcoming in the linear price 
    algorithm (i.e. price = demand / supply), which is that any change in 
    supply or demand is exactly offset by a change in price.  This makes it 
    impossible to increase revenue.  
    
    Solving this problem required making the price algorithm non-linear, but 
    there are many to do that.  I like this algorithm because its flexible and 
    the meanings of its parameters are relatively easy to understand.  I tried 
    making the profit curve a logistic function, but it lacked the flexibility 
    of having a (slowly) increasing asymptote.  I also tried making the price 
    curve an exponential decay, but this led to an undesirable peak in the 
    profit curve.
